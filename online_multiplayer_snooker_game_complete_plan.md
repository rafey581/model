# Online Multiplayer Snooker Gaming Platform — Complete Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The project is a professional web-based multiplayer snooker gaming platform.

The main concept is:

- Users create accounts.
- Users have a wallet.
- Users can find other players online.
- Two players enter a snooker match.
- The match is played in real time.
- The game should have realistic snooker physics and a high-quality table/interface.
- The intended commercial model is real-money/value wagering.
- Players may deposit cryptocurrency.
- Players can use the deposited value to enter matches.
- The winner receives the applicable prize.
- The platform keeps a predefined commission/fee.
- Players can withdraw their eligible balance.

The initial discussion considered USD/PKR and later focused on cryptocurrency as the deposit/withdrawal method.

Important: the technical design is feasible, but real-money wagering is a regulated activity. The final launch model must be limited to jurisdictions and users for which the required gambling, gaming, payment and virtual-asset permissions are established.

# 2. Core Product Concept

The desired product is not simply a normal snooker game.

It is intended to be a complete online gaming platform containing:

1. User accounts
2. Player profiles
3. Online multiplayer
4. Snooker game engine
5. Matchmaking
6. Wallet
7. Deposits
8. Match entry/wager accounting
9. Winner determination
10. Prize calculation
11. Platform commission
12. Withdrawals
13. Transaction history
14. Match history
15. Admin dashboard
16. Security and anti-cheat systems

The main user journey should be simple:

```text
Create Account
      ↓
Login
      ↓
Wallet
      ↓
Deposit
      ↓
Choose Match
      ↓
Find Opponent
      ↓
Enter Match
      ↓
Play Snooker
      ↓
Server Determines Winner
      ↓
Prize / Platform Fee
      ↓
Winner Balance Updated
      ↓
Withdrawal
```

---

# 3. Real-Money Match Model

The original intended model is a peer-to-peer match where players put monetary value into a match.

Example:

```text
Player A = $10
Player B = $10

Total match value = $20

Winner = $18
Platform commission = $2
```

The exact commission percentage should be configurable from the admin panel.

For example:

```text
Entry amount: $10 per player
Players: 2
Gross pool: $20
Platform fee: 10%
Platform fee: $2
Winner prize: $18
```

The system should never calculate the final result only in the browser.

The server should be authoritative.

---

# 4. Cryptocurrency Version

The project later considered using cryptocurrency instead of fiat currency.

The intended flow is:

```text
Crypto Deposit
      ↓
Platform Wallet
      ↓
Available Balance
      ↓
Match Entry
      ↓
Snooker Match
      ↓
Winner Determined
      ↓
Prize Calculation
      ↓
Winner Balance
      ↓
Crypto Withdrawal
```

Possible assets could include stablecoins or other supported cryptocurrencies, depending on the final legal and payment setup.

A stablecoin-based accounting model could be easier to understand because the platform can display balances in a relatively stable unit.

Example:

```text
Player deposits:
10 USDT

Player enters:
10 USDT match

Opponent enters:
10 USDT match

Gross pool:
20 USDT

Platform fee:
2 USDT

Winner:
18 USDT
```

The exact supported asset, blockchain/network and settlement mechanism must be selected after evaluating the target jurisdiction and payment provider.

---

# 5. Main Limitation: Gambling / Wagering

The main issue discussed throughout the project is gambling/wagering regulation.

The technical system can be programmed.

The difficulty is whether the proposed business model is legally permitted in the jurisdictions where it operates and accepts players.

The relevant model is:

```text
Player deposits monetary value
        ↓
Player risks that value in a match
        ↓
Game outcome determines winner
        ↓
Winner receives monetary value
        ↓
Platform takes a commission
```

This can be considered real-money wagering/gambling depending on the applicable law.

Changing the payment method from:

- PKR
- USD
- BTC
- USDT
- USDC
- another cryptocurrency

does not automatically remove the gambling/wagering issue.

Crypto creates an additional virtual-asset/payment regulatory layer.

---

# 6. Important Distinction: Technical vs Legal Problem

## Technical side

The following are engineering problems:

- Snooker physics
- Graphics
- Multiplayer
- Matchmaking
- User accounts
- Wallet ledger
- Deposits
- Withdrawals
- Blockchain monitoring
- Payment APIs
- Prize calculation
- Commission calculation
- Admin panel
- Security
- Anti-cheat

These can be designed and developed.

## Legal/compliance side

The following require jurisdiction-specific review:

- Whether the game is legally classified as gambling/wagering
- Whether a gambling licence is required
- Whether peer-to-peer wagering is permitted
- Whether crypto wagering is permitted
- Whether crypto services require authorization
- Which users can participate
- Age restrictions
- KYC requirements
- AML requirements
- Geolocation requirements
- Payment-provider requirements
- Responsible gaming requirements
- Withdrawal requirements

The software should therefore be designed so the real-money module can be controlled by jurisdiction and compliance rules.

---

# 7. Pakistan Discussion

The project discussion specifically considered Pakistan.

The important point is:

> The fact that many gambling/betting websites can be accessed from Pakistan does not automatically mean that those platforms are legally authorized to operate in Pakistan.

A website may be:

- licensed in another country;
- targeting another market;
- accessible despite local restrictions;
- operating without the authorization required locally;
- using international payment/crypto infrastructure.

Therefore, seeing existing betting platforms in Pakistan is not sufficient evidence that the same model is legally permitted for a new platform.

The specific legal question for this project is:

> Can a peer-to-peer online snooker platform offering real-money/crypto wagering legally operate from Pakistan and accept Pakistani users?

That requires current, jurisdiction-specific legal review.

---

# 8. Pakistan + Crypto

The project also considered using only cryptocurrency to avoid fiat payment issues.

The conclusion was:

> Crypto can change the payment mechanism, but it does not automatically remove gambling regulation.

There are potentially two separate regulatory areas:

### Gambling / wagering

Players are still putting something of monetary value at risk based on the result of a game.

### Virtual assets

Crypto-related services can have their own licensing, authorization, KYC and AML requirements.

Therefore:

```text
PKR → USDT
```

does not make the underlying wager disappear.

---

# 9. VPN Idea

Another idea discussed was:

> Host the platform in a country where the model is permitted and allow Pakistani players to access it through VPN.

A VPN may technically change the IP address visible to the website, but this does not automatically make participation legally permitted.

A real-money platform can use multiple compliance signals, such as:

- IP geolocation
- VPN/proxy detection
- KYC documents
- Payment information
- Phone number
- Withdrawal information
- Account information
- Risk/fraud signals

Therefore:

```text
Foreign hosting
+
VPN access
```

is not a reliable legal solution for accepting restricted users.

If the platform is licensed in a particular jurisdiction, its licence conditions and geographic restrictions must be followed.

---

# 10. Possible Legal/Business Solutions

There are three broad approaches.

## Option A — Licensed Real-Money Platform

Operate in a jurisdiction where the specific wagering model is permitted and obtain the required authorization/licence.

Possible requirements may include:

- KYC
- Age verification
- AML
- Responsible gaming
- Geolocation
- Fraud monitoring
- Payment compliance
- Customer-fund controls
- Record keeping
- Player protection
- Dispute procedures

The exact requirements depend on the jurisdiction.

---

## Option B — Jurisdiction-Restricted Platform

The platform can be designed for specific jurisdictions.

For example:

```text
Player attempts registration
        ↓
Country / KYC verification
        ↓
Is the jurisdiction allowed?
       / \
     YES  NO
      ↓    ↓
 Continue  Block
```

The platform should not simply rely on VPN access.

Jurisdiction rules should be enforced through the application's compliance system.

---

## Option C — Virtual Credits

If real-money wagering cannot legally be launched, the same game can operate using non-withdrawable virtual credits.

Example:

```text
Player gets 1,000 virtual credits
        ↓
Match entry
        ↓
Winner gets credits
        ↓
Credits remain inside game
```

There is no real-money withdrawal of the wagered value.

This allows development and testing of:

- Multiplayer
- Matchmaking
- Wallet logic
- Rankings
- Leaderboards
- Game economy
- Snooker physics
- Admin systems

without immediately activating real-money wagering.

---

# 11. Game Quality Requirements

The user wants the game to feel professional and high quality.

The snooker experience should include:

- High-quality snooker table
- Realistic table proportions
- Professional-looking cloth and cushions
- Realistic balls
- Cue
- Lighting/shadows
- Smooth animations
- Realistic ball movement
- Collision physics
- Cushion physics
- Pocket detection
- Ball friction
- Cue power
- Cue aiming
- Spin/English
- Camera movement
- Smooth online synchronization
- Responsive game UI

The game should prioritize smooth gameplay rather than only static graphics.

---

# 12. Snooker Rules

The game should implement proper snooker rules.

Potential features:

- 15 red balls
- Six colours
- Cue ball
- Breaking/opening play
- Red/colour sequence
- Fouls
- Free ball rules where applicable
- Snookers
- Points
- Break calculation
- Turn changes
- End of frame
- Final colours
- Frame winner
- Match winner
- Best-of-3
- Best-of-5
- Other configurable match formats

The rules engine should run on the server where possible so players cannot modify the outcome.

---

# 13. Server-Authoritative Game

This is one of the most important technical decisions.

The browser should not be trusted to determine:

- Whether a shot is valid
- Whether a ball entered a pocket
- Whether a foul happened
- The score
- The winner
- The prize

Instead:

```text
Player Browser
      ↓
Shot Input
      ↓
Game Server
      ↓
Physics / Rules Validation
      ↓
Authoritative Game State
      ↓
Both Players
```

The client mainly displays the game.

The server controls the actual game state.

This reduces cheating and manipulation.

---

# 14. Multiplayer Architecture

Real-time multiplayer could use WebSockets.

Possible architecture:

```text
                 ┌───────────────┐
                 │    Browser A  │
                 └───────┬───────┘
                         │
                      WebSocket
                         │
                         ▼
                ┌─────────────────┐
                │ Multiplayer     │
                │ Game Server     │
                └────────┬────────┘
                         │
                      WebSocket
                         │
                         ▼
                 ┌───────────────┐
                 │    Browser B  │
                 └───────────────┘
```

The game server maintains:

- Match ID
- Player IDs
- Current turn
- Ball positions
- Ball velocities
- Current score
- Frame state
- Fouls
- Match timer
- Connection state
- Winner
- Match status

---

# 15. Suggested Technology Stack

## Frontend

Possible technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- WebGL
- Phaser.js or another browser game framework
- Responsive UI

For a polished 2D/2.5D snooker experience, a browser game engine can make development easier.

For more advanced graphics, a WebGL-based 3D engine could be considered.

## Backend

Possible:

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- WebSocket / Socket.IO
- REST API
- Authentication system

## Database

Possible:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

The database stores permanent records.

## Real-Time Layer

Possible:

- WebSockets
- Redis for scaling/session state
- Dedicated game-server processes

---

# 16. User Account System

Users should be able to:

- Register
- Login
- Logout
- Reset password
- Verify email if required
- Complete profile
- Upload avatar
- View balance
- View match history
- View statistics
- View rankings
- View transactions

For a real-money platform, account verification should be integrated with the applicable KYC requirements.

---

# 17. Wallet System

The wallet should be based on a proper transaction ledger rather than simply storing one editable balance field.

Recommended concept:

```text
wallets
    ↓
wallet_transactions
```

Every balance change should have a transaction record.

Examples:

```text
DEPOSIT
MATCH_ENTRY
MATCH_REFUND
PRIZE
PLATFORM_FEE
WITHDRAWAL
WITHDRAWAL_FEE
ADJUSTMENT
```

Each transaction should have:

- Unique transaction ID
- User ID
- Amount
- Currency/asset
- Transaction type
- Status
- Reference
- Timestamp
- Balance before
- Balance after

This creates an auditable financial history.

---

# 18. Crypto Deposit System

If permitted for the selected jurisdiction and payment arrangement, a possible deposit flow is:

```text
Player clicks Deposit
        ↓
Selects supported crypto/network
        ↓
System creates deposit request
        ↓
Unique address/payment request
        ↓
Player sends crypto
        ↓
Blockchain transaction detected
        ↓
Required confirmations
        ↓
Backend verifies transaction
        ↓
Deposit marked confirmed
        ↓
Wallet credited
```

The backend should not credit a deposit merely because a client says that a transaction was sent.

The blockchain transaction must be independently verified.

---

# 19. Crypto Withdrawal System

Possible flow:

```text
Player enters withdrawal address
        ↓
Amount requested
        ↓
KYC/risk/compliance checks
        ↓
Withdrawal request created
        ↓
Balance reserved
        ↓
Admin/automatic approval
        ↓
Transaction broadcast
        ↓
Blockchain transaction ID stored
        ↓
Withdrawal completed
```

Important safeguards:

- Withdrawal limits
- Address validation
- Confirmation requirements
- Risk checks
- Rate limits
- Manual review for suspicious transactions
- Duplicate-withdrawal prevention
- Double-spend/accounting protection

---

# 20. Payment Provider Approach

Three broad approaches were discussed.

## Third-Party Crypto Gateway

Advantages:

- Faster integration
- Deposit detection
- Webhooks
- Payment APIs
- Potential payout APIs
- Less blockchain infrastructure to maintain

Possible providers mentioned during the discussion included services such as:

- NOWPayments
- CoinsPaid / CryptoProcessing
- B2BINPAY
- CoinGate
- Cryptomus
- 0xProcessing

These names were discussed as possible examples, not as verified recommendations.

Before selecting a provider, verify:

- Current availability
- Jurisdiction restrictions
- Gambling/iGaming policy
- KYC requirements
- Supported assets
- Supported networks
- Deposit fees
- Withdrawal fees
- Settlement terms
- Licensing/authorization
- API reliability

---

# 21. Self-Hosted Crypto Infrastructure

Another approach is to control the blockchain/payment infrastructure.

Possible technologies discussed:

- BTCPay Server
- Blockchain RPC providers
- Infura
- Alchemy
- QuickNode
- HD wallets
- BIP32/BIP44 wallet derivation
- Blockchain monitoring

The basic architecture could be:

```text
User
 ↓
Deposit Request
 ↓
Unique Address
 ↓
Blockchain
 ↓
Blockchain Monitor
 ↓
Backend
 ↓
Wallet Ledger
```

For payouts:

```text
Withdrawal Request
 ↓
Risk/Compliance
 ↓
Hot Wallet
 ↓
Blockchain Transaction
 ↓
Transaction ID
 ↓
User
```

Self-hosting provides more control but introduces significantly more security responsibility.

---

# 22. Hybrid Payment Architecture

A hybrid system could use:

```text
Third-party provider
        ↓
Deposits
        +
Custom withdrawal infrastructure
```

or:

```text
Crypto gateway
        ↓
Deposit
        ↓
Internal wallet ledger
        ↓
Approved withdrawal provider
```

The final architecture should depend on the selected jurisdiction, provider contracts and security requirements.

---

# 23. Fiat Payment Discussion

The conversation also considered:

- Easypaisa
- JazzCash
- Bank deposits
- Google Pay
- PKR → crypto conversion

The intended flow would be:

```text
PKR Payment
     ↓
Payment Gateway
     ↓
Conversion
     ↓
Crypto / Wallet Credit
```

However, this introduces additional payment-provider, financial, gambling and virtual-asset compliance questions.

For a crypto-only platform, this entire fiat-on-ramp layer can be removed from the first version.

That makes the technical flow simpler:

```text
Crypto
  ↓
Platform Wallet
  ↓
Match
  ↓
Prize
  ↓
Crypto Withdrawal
```

But it does not remove the underlying wagering regulation.

---

# 24. Admin Panel

The admin dashboard should provide complete operational control.

Potential sections:

### Dashboard

- Total users
- Active users
- Active matches
- Completed matches
- Deposits
- Withdrawals
- Platform revenue
- Fees
- Suspicious activity

### Users

- Search users
- View profile
- Account status
- Verification status
- Wallet balance
- Transaction history
- Match history
- Restrictions

### Matches

- Live matches
- Completed matches
- Cancelled matches
- Match IDs
- Players
- Entry amount
- Result
- Prize
- Platform fee

### Wallet

- Deposits
- Withdrawals
- Pending withdrawals
- Failed transactions
- Blockchain transaction IDs
- Manual review

### Settings

- Commission percentage
- Minimum match amount
- Maximum match amount
- Withdrawal limits
- Supported assets
- Supported networks
- Match settings
- Maintenance mode

---

# 25. Match Lifecycle

A match should have clear states.

Example:

```text
CREATED
   ↓
WAITING_FOR_PLAYER
   ↓
PLAYER_JOINED
   ↓
FUNDS_LOCKED
   ↓
MATCH_STARTED
   ↓
MATCH_IN_PROGRESS
   ↓
MATCH_COMPLETED
   ↓
RESULT_VERIFIED
   ↓
PRIZE_SETTLED
```

Possible exceptional states:

```text
CANCELLED
REFUNDED
DISPUTED
ABANDONED
```

This makes financial and game accounting much safer.

---

# 26. Escrow / Locked Balance Concept

When players enter a paid match, their available balance should not simply disappear.

Instead:

```text
Available Balance
        ↓
Locked Match Balance
```

Example:

```text
Player balance = 100 USDT

Match entry = 10 USDT

Available = 90 USDT
Locked = 10 USDT
```

After the result:

```text
Winner:
Locked amount → prize balance

Platform:
Commission → platform balance
```

If a match is cancelled under a valid condition:

```text
Locked amount → returned to player
```

This prevents accounting errors.

---

# 27. Anti-Cheat System

Because the game has monetary value, anti-cheat is critical.

Potential measures:

- Server-authoritative physics
- Server-authoritative scoring
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Impossible-action detection
- Tampered client detection
- Match replay logs
- Shot history
- Suspicious timing detection
- Multi-account detection
- Device/IP risk signals
- Abnormal win-rate analysis
- Automated account restrictions

The platform should keep enough game-event data to investigate disputes.

---

# 28. Match Replay / Audit System

For every match, the server can store:

- Match ID
- Player IDs
- Start time
- End time
- Initial state
- Shot events
- Cue parameters
- Ball states
- Fouls
- Scores
- Turn changes
- Disconnects
- Final result

This makes it possible to reconstruct or audit a disputed match.

---

# 29. Disconnect Handling

Internet connections can fail.

The game should define rules for:

- Player disconnects
- Temporary reconnection
- Timeout
- Abandonment
- Server failure
- Browser refresh
- Network switching

Example:

```text
Player disconnects
        ↓
Grace period
        ↓
Reconnect?
   /          \
 YES          NO
 ↓             ↓
Continue     Apply match rule
```

For real-money matches, these rules must be clearly defined before launch.

---

# 30. Security

The platform should use:

- HTTPS
- Secure password hashing
- Secure sessions/tokens
- 2FA where appropriate
- CSRF protection
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting
- API authentication
- Webhook signature verification
- Secrets stored outside source code
- Database backups
- Encryption for sensitive information
- Role-based admin permissions
- Audit logs

Private keys for crypto wallets must never be exposed to the browser.

---

# 31. Database Concept

Potential database tables:

```text
users
profiles
sessions
kyc_records
wallets
wallet_transactions
crypto_deposits
crypto_withdrawals
matches
match_players
game_events
match_results
commissions
notifications
admin_users
admin_actions
fraud_flags
```

Additional tables can be added based on the final architecture.

---

# 32. Revenue Model

The main proposed revenue model is a percentage commission from completed paid matches.

Example:

```text
Gross Match Pool = 20 USDT
Platform Fee = 10%
Platform Revenue = 2 USDT
Winner Prize = 18 USDT
```

The admin should be able to configure the commission percentage.

Potential future revenue sources could include:

- Match commissions
- Tournament fees
- Premium memberships
- Sponsorships
- Advertising

Any real-money revenue model must be reviewed under the applicable regulatory framework.

---

# 33. Tournament System — Future Feature

After the core 1v1 system works, tournaments could be added.

Possible formats:

- Knockout
- Double elimination
- Round robin
- Best-of-3
- Best-of-5
- Scheduled tournaments

Example:

```text
16 Players
     ↓
Round of 16
     ↓
Quarter Finals
     ↓
Semi Final
     ↓
Final
```

Tournament entry fees and cash prizes would create additional regulatory considerations and should only be enabled where permitted.

---

# 34. Leaderboards and Rankings

The platform could have:

- Global ranking
- Weekly ranking
- Monthly ranking
- Win/loss record
- Total frames
- Highest break
- Total matches
- Winning percentage

Ranking systems should be independent from the financial ledger.

---

# 35. Player Profile

Potential profile:

```text
Avatar
Username
Country
Matches Played
Wins
Losses
Win Rate
Highest Break
Current Rating
Ranking
Recent Matches
```

Sensitive information should not be publicly displayed.

---

# 36. Notifications

Notifications can include:

- Opponent found
- Match invitation
- Match starting
- Match result
- Deposit confirmation
- Withdrawal status
- Security alert
- Account verification
- Tournament notification

---

# 38. Recommended Architecture

A high-level production architecture:

```text
                    INTERNET
                       │
                       ▼

   └────────────────┘
```

---

# 39. Important Architecture Principle

The game, wallet and payment systems should be separated.

```text
Game Engine
     │
     ▼
Match Service
     │
     ▼
Settlement Service
     │
     ▼
Wallet Ledger
     │
     ▼
Payment / Crypto Service
```

This makes it easier to:

- Test the game without real money
- Change payment providers
- Add/remove supported assets
- Add jurisdiction restrictions
- Audit transactions
- Handle disputes
- Scale the platform

---

# 40. MVP Recommendation

The first working version should focus on:

### Player

- Register/login
- Profile
- Lobby
- Find opponent
- 1v1 snooker

# 41. Real-Money Module Design

The system can be designed so that real-money functionality is a separate module.

Example:

```text
Core Game
   │
   ├── Free Matches
   ├── Virtual Credit Matches
   │
   └── Real-Money Matches
             │
             ├── KYC
             ├── Jurisdiction Check
             ├── Wallet
             ├── Deposit
             ├── Escrow
             ├── Settlement
             └── Withdrawal
```

This is useful because the core game can continue operating even if a particular jurisdiction does not permit real-money wagering.

# 42. Key Business Question

Before production launch, the project must answer:

> Where will the company legally operate, and which jurisdictions will be allowed to participate?

This determines:

- Gambling licensing
- Crypto authorization
- Payment providers
- KYC provider
- AML requirements
- Age verification
- Geolocation
- Tax obligations
- Terms and conditions
- Responsible gaming requirements

This should be decided before connecting production deposits and withdrawals.

# 43. Current Project Direction

The intended product remains:

> A high-quality online multiplayer snooker website with accounts, real-time matches, a wallet, cryptocurrency deposits/withdrawals, peer-to-peer paid matches, automatic winner settlement, and platform commission.

The technical plan should be built around:

**Professional Game + Real-Time Multiplayer + Secure Server Authority + Auditable Wallet + Modular Crypto Payments + Strong Anti-Cheat + Jurisdiction/Compliance Controls**

The real-money component should not be treated as simply another UI feature. It is a separate financial and regulatory subsystem.

## Main technical challenges

1. Realistic snooker physics
2. Smooth real-time multiplayer
3. Server-authoritative game state
4. Anti-cheat
5. Wallet accounting
6. Crypto payment integration
7. Secure withdrawals
8. Match settlement
9. Admin system
10. Scalability

## Main non-technical challenge

**Real-money wagering/gambling and crypto regulatory compliance.**

The existence of other gambling websites accessible in Pakistan does not by itself establish that this particular platform can legally operate there.

A VPN does not automatically solve the jurisdiction issue.

Crypto does not automatically remove gambling regulation.

The appropriate approach is to determine the target licensed/authorized jurisdiction first and then configure the platform's payment, KYC, geolocation and wagering systems accordingly.

# 45. Development Principle

Build the platform in a way that keeps these components modular:

```text
                 SNooker Core
                      │
             ┌────────┴────────┐
             │                 │
        Multiplayer         Matchmaking
             │                 │
             └────────┬────────┘
                      │
                 Match Service
                      │
              ┌───────┴────────┐
              │                │
       Virtual Credits    Real-Money Module
                              │
                     ┌────────┼────────┐
                     │        │        │
                    KYC    Wallet    Crypto
                              │
                       Deposit/Withdraw
```

This allows the game to be developed and tested independently while keeping the regulated real-money functionality isolated and controllable.

## End Goal

A polished, scalable and secure online snooker platform that can support real-time competitive gameplay and, where legally authorized, real-money cryptocurrency matches with automated settlement and a configurable platform commission.
